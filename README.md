# Oral-PBBM-workflow
Within this repository, we distribute the physiologically-based biopharmaceutics (PBBM) workflow for orally administered drug products that was previously published by Vrenken et al. [[1](#References)]. The workflow consists of three tools that build upon each other:

The following decision tree assists in determining which features of the OSP Solubility Toolbox and the in vitro dissolution model are relevant based on the type of input provided.

## OSP Solubility Toolbox

The OSP Solubility Toolbox has been presented previously by Vrenken et al. [[1](#References)]. The toolbox is a Shiny App based on R which can be found, along with a detailed guidance for users, in the respective [sub-folder](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Oral-PBBM-Workflow/tree/main/OSP-Solubility-Toolbox).

## In Vitro Dissolution Model

The in vitro dissolution model has been presented previously by Vrenken et al. [[1](#References)]. A MoBi template file integrating the novel dissolution model as well as a detailed guidance for users can be found in the respective [sub-folder](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Oral-PBBM-Workflow/tree/main/In-Vitro-Dissolution-Model).
