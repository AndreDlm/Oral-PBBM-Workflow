# In Vitro Dissolution Model

This folder contains the *in vitro* dissolution model developed by Vrenken et al. [[1](#References)]. The model is implemented in MoBi and is designed to simulate drug release kinetics from various formulations. 
It accounts for the influence of bile salt micelles on solubility, as well as the effects of particle size and hydrodynamic conditions on the diffusion layer thickness during the dissolution process.
The model is built upon the [OSP Solubility Toolbox](https://github.com/AndreDlm/Oral-PBBM-Workflow/tree/main/OSP-Solubility-Toolbox), with several parameters in this dissolution model derived from the OSP Solubility Toolbox.

## Prerequisites

To use the OSP Solubility Toolbox, ensure you have the [OSP Software Suite](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Suite/releases) installed (version 11.3 or higher).

## Usage

Adjust the following parameter values in the Parameter Start Values Building Block `API Properties`:
